1. Definitions
	-	Project
		-	In reference to Nutanix, a project defines a group of users, such as a team of engineers collaborating on an engineering project. You can assign local users, Active Directory Users, or Active Directory Groups various roles in a project that grant different permissions. These users then collaborate on blueprints, applications, marketplace items, and their underlying constructs. You can assign a project any number of cloud endpoints, including AHV, VMware, AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes, which the associated users or groups can then use.
