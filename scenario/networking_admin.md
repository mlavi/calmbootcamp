Student,

The network infrastructure will consist of separate production and development networks. The production network will be managed using IPAM/DHCP from an IP Pool provided by the Network Operations group.  The production network will be on vlan 0, using the 172.31.0.0/24 network. The IP Pool will use a Start address of 172.31.0.210 and an End address of 172.31.0.230. The development network will be unmanaged on VLAN 101 using the 172.31.101.0/24 network.
Respectfully,

Net Admin
