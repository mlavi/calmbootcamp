Hi Student,

The Systems Administrators provision the servers for us, so I'm not sure sure what the hardware requirements are. We do need to be able to modify the amount of resources on our servers without powering them down though.

The company requires that the databases need to be able to be back up after an outage within 15 minutes, and we can lose no more than 1 hours worth of work.

Respectfully,

Database Admin
