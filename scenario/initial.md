Student,

It has come to our attention that our main revenue producing application stack is no long able to meet the companies needs for performance and availability, We have been considering a Hyperconverged solution with plans to expand into the cloud in the near future. We have acquired an HCI cluster to do a proof of concept.
We would like you to interview all the business stakeholders to determine their processing needs, create a business requirements matrix and then build out a test solution for evaluation.
We would like to see a 3- tier application stack with a database, application server and web server.  An identified requirement is to have separate production and development environments, with built-in data protection. Additional tests for VM workload expansion (cloning), the ability to dynamically add CPU/Memory resources to online virtual machines and backup/restore with snapshot capabilities is required. Final verification is the removal of a key VM and performing a full restoration.

Respectfully,

CTO
