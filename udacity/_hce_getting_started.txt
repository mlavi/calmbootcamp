Hybrid Cloud Engineer Nanodegree

Notes:
- Objectives answer "Student will be able to" and "Student will learn just enough to"
- Artificially constraining objectives to 4 helps focus outcomes and lesson scope
- Course 4 has two re-create objectives, with TBD:
  - source: TBD, from decompiled JSON, boilerplate, or scratch?
  - each could also be slightly extended with new use in the DSL.

- Course 1: Modern Private Cloud
  - Objectives:
    - 40% of ECA, filtered to simulations
  - Project (owned by Wes):
    - Configure HCI VM uptime surviving infrastructure failures?
    - Trojan horse: monolithic LAMP VM for taste of course 2+ scenarios?
- Course 2: Private Cloud Automation
  - Objectives: (see [2/lesson_learning_objectives](hce/2/lesson_learning_objectives.md) for more detail)
  - Project: Three tier web app on LAMP stack variant blueprint with AHV VMs and one SaaS action
- Course 3: Hybrid Cloud Automation

    - Justify public cloud use with security, lock-in, and global load balancing considerations
    - Learn just enough AWS free-tier to add to Calm settings: provider and a project
    - Configure a hybrid web tier blueprint: clone and localize web tier on AWS, rehost database on public cloud
    - Understand multiple Hybrid Cloud resource management with Beam
